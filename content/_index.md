Games In The Box is a certain minigame system for Spigot servers, with the idea of "multiple games in a single arena". It's mainly for hub & event places, but admins can use this in more scenarios (like a separated gamemode), thanks to the highly flexibility it has. Developers can also make their own games and add it via the expansion system or just a hook.
